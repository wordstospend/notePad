The purpose of this project is to allow a veriaty of note taking functions

the feature list will grow and shrink I'm sure but here is a rough stab at it

Feature List
============

A mind map like note taking feature.
  each bubble is a map in and of it self.
  each bubble has a Title and a note body
  each bubble shows it's Tittle and as much of the body as possible
  each bubble is connected to other bubbles by a directional arrow
       arrows are uni or bi directional
       arrows move around and stretch so they are never covering or hidden 
       	      by bubbles
  

PDF can be displayed as backgrounds of notes
  notes over slides can be transparent or opaic
  

Data Structures
===============
A note has a 
  title, text body,
 
bubble
  a note
  subgraph
  parent graph
  toSiblings
  fromSiblings
  biSiblings
  xloc
  yloc

SubGraph
   a subgraph contains
     - bubble(s) with there location locked.
     -  parent Bubble
     - A Title (from note from parent bubble)
     - and a body of text at the top (from note)


Controllers
===========

Bubble
  needs to resize and be movable
  we'll being using a method simillar to MKAnotations
  we will have a set of objects called Bubbles with (x,y)
  We'll alloc or grab from the pool and Views called BubbleViews
  just before they come into view and release to the pool after
  they leave view

  Questions: how do I deal with the fact the some bubbles might be larger?
  	     sometimes a bubbleView won't have been created by the time
	     it comes into view. I could have a buffer around the frame of 
	     the viewing area but that doesn't really give me a way consistant
	     solution to this problem.  The buffer would need to match the 
	     size of the larges bubbleView and that would cuase problems 
	     in resizing a bubbleView
	     
  Answer: for now I'm going to just make the refresh area larger than the view
  	  area and just hope that I make it large enough. I can maybe get 
	  fancier later.

Graph
  needs to be a subclass of scrollview
  needs needs to support centering on something
  resizeing to fit bubbles
