The purpose of this project is to allow a veriaty of note taking functions

the feature list will grow and shrink I'm sure but here is a rough stab at it

Feature List
============

A mind map like note taking feature.
  each bubble is a map in and of it self.
  each bubble has a Title and a note body
  each bubble shows it's Tittle and as much of the body as possible
  each bubble is connected to other bubbles by a directional arrow
       arrows are uni or bi directional
       arrows move around and stretch so they are never covering or hidden by bubbles
  

PDF can be displayed as backgrounds of notes
  notes over slides can be transparent or opaic
  

Data Structures
===============
A note has a 
  title, text body,
 
bubble
  a note
  subgraph
  parent graph
  toSiblings
  fromSiblings
  biSiblings
  xloc
  yloc

SubGraph
   a subgraph contains
     - bubble(s) with there location locked.
     -  parent Bubble
     - A Title (from note from parent bubble)
     - and a body of text at the top (from note)


Controllers
===========

Bubble
  needs to resize and be movable
  
Graph
  needs to be a subclass of scrollview
  needs needs to support centering on something
  resizeing to fit bubbles
